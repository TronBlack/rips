People wishing to submit RIPs, first should propose their idea or document to the Ravencoin forums. After discussion, please open a PR. After copy-editing and acceptance, it will be published here.

We are fairly liberal with approving RIPs, and try not to be too involved in decision making on behalf of the community. 

Having a RIP here does not make it a formally accepted standard until its status becomes Final or Active.

Those proposing changes should consider that ultimately consent may rest with the consensus of the Ravencoin community which includes developers, miners, economic majority, and nodes.
